## üöÄ Deployment Commands

### 1. Infrastructure Security Update
```bash
# Update IAM permissions with least privilege
cd infrastructure
pulumi up --preview  # Review changes first
pulumi up           # Apply security updates
```

### 2. Application Security Test
```bash
# Run security tests
npm run test:security
npm run test:integration

# Build and test container
docker build -t adcraft-security-test .
docker run --rm adcraft-security-test npm run test
```

### 3. Security Configuration Verification
```bash
# Verify environment variables are set securely
# Check that no secrets are in source code
grep -r "password\|secret\|key" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git

# Verify security headers in deployed application
curl -I https://your-domain.com/api/health
```

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### Security Headers Test
```bash
# Test security headers
curl -I https://adcraft-service-1029593129571.asia-northeast1.run.app/ | grep -E "(X-Frame-Options|X-Content-Type-Options|Content-Security-Policy|Strict-Transport-Security)"
```

### Rate Limiting Test
```bash
# Test rate limiting (adjust URL as needed)
for i in {1..65}; do
  curl -w "%{http_code}\n" -o /dev/null -s https://your-domain.com/api/status/test-job
done
# Should return 429 after exceeding limits
```

### Security Monitoring Test
```bash
# Test security monitoring endpoint (admin access required)
curl https://your-domain.com/api/admin/security
```

### Content Security Policy Test
```bash
# Verify CSP is working
curl -H "Accept: text/html" https://your-domain.com/ | grep -o "Content-Security-Policy.*"
```

## üö® Security Incident Response

### In Case of Security Alert

1. **Immediate Response**
   - Check security dashboard: `/api/admin/security`
   - Review recent security events and alerts
   - Identify affected endpoints and sources

2. **Threat Assessment**
   - Determine severity and scope of the incident
   - Check for signs of successful attacks
   - Review system integrity

3. **Containment**
   - Block suspicious IP addresses if necessary
   - Increase rate limiting for affected endpoints
   - Consider temporary service restrictions

4. **Investigation**
   - Export security report for analysis
   - Review logs for attack patterns
   - Document findings and remediation steps

5. **Recovery**
   - Apply necessary security patches
   - Update security configurations
   - Monitor for continued threats

## üìã Security Maintenance Schedule

### Daily
- [ ] Review security alerts and events
- [ ] Check for failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Monitor error rates and unusual patterns

### Weekly
- [ ] Review security metrics and trends
- [ ] Update security rules if needed
- [ ] Check for new vulnerabilities in dependencies

### Monthly
- [ ] Full security audit and penetration testing
- [ ] Update security documentation
- [ ] Review and test incident response procedures

## üîí Production Security Recommendations

### Immediate (Pre-Production)
1. **Implement proper API authentication**
2. **Configure Workload Identity instead of service account keys**
3. **Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting**
4. **Create proper backup and recovery procedures**

### Medium Term
1. **Implement user authentication system**
2. **Add comprehensive audit logging**
3. **Set up automated security testing in CI/CD**
4. **Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)**

### Long Term
1. **Regular penetration testing**
2. **Security team training and awareness**
3. **Compliance auditing (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.)**
4. **Advanced threat detection and response**
