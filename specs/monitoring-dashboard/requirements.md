# Requirements: Monitoring Dashboard

## Overview
A public monitoring dashboard page that provides comprehensive system health, performance metrics, and budget tracking for the AdCraft AI application. This dashboard will be accessible to all users (including judges) for transparency and demo purposes.

## User Stories

### US-1: Dashboard Access
**As a** user (including judges and demo visitors)

- WHEN the user accesses the monitoring page, THEN the system SHALL display the dashboard without authentication requirements

### US-2: Budget Information Migration
**As a** user interested in cost transparency  
**I want to** view detailed budget information on the monitoring dashboard  
**So that** I can understand the system's cost efficiency and remaining budget

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN the user views the main generation screen, THEN the system SHALL NOT display any budget information
- WHEN the user views the monitoring dashboard, THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive budget information including:
  - Current spend vs total budget
  - Remaining budget and burn rate
  - Cost projections
  - Service-wise cost breakdown (Veo, Gemini, Storage, etc.)
- WHEN budget data is updated, THEN the monitoring dashboard SHALL reflect current information within 30 seconds

### US-3: System Health Display
**As a** user monitoring system reliability  
**I want to** view comprehensive system health metrics  
**So that** I can understand system status and performance

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN the user views the monitoring dashboard, THEN the system SHALL display:
  - Overall system health status (healthy/degraded/unhealthy/critical)
  - Individual service health checks (Firestore, Cloud Storage, Vertex AI, Veo, etc.)
  - System uptime information
  - Recent system issues and warnings
- WHEN system health changes, THEN the dashboard SHALL update within 30 seconds
- WHEN critical issues occur, THEN the system SHALL highlight them prominently

### US-4: Performance Analytics
**As a** user evaluating system performance  
**I want to** view performance metrics and trends  
**So that** I can assess system efficiency and scalability

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN the user views the monitoring dashboard, THEN the system SHALL display:
  - API response times and error rates
  - Video generation success rates
  - Processing time breakdowns by stage
  - Request volume and concurrent users
- WHEN performance data spans multiple time periods, THEN the system SHALL provide trend visualizations
- WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded, THEN the system SHALL indicate warnings or alerts

### US-5: Real-time Updates
**As a** user monitoring active system operations  
**I want to** see real-time or near real-time updates  
**So that** I can track current system activity

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN the monitoring dashboard is loaded, THEN the system SHALL establish real-time data connections
- WHEN system metrics change, THEN the dashboard SHALL update within 30 seconds
- WHEN the user's connection is lost, THEN the system SHALL indicate connection status
- WHEN data cannot be retrieved, THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error states

### US-6: Mobile Responsiveness
**As a** user accessing the dashboard on mobile devices  
**I want to** view monitoring information on smaller screens  
**So that** I can monitor the system from any device

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN the user views the dashboard on mobile devices (320px+), THEN the system SHALL display essential metrics in a single-column layout
- WHEN the user views the dashboard on tablets (768px+), THEN the system SHALL display metrics in a two-column layout
- WHEN the user views detailed charts on mobile, THEN the system SHALL provide simplified or touch-friendly visualizations
- WHEN the user interacts with dashboard elements on mobile, THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch targets (44px minimum)

### US-7: Beautiful Data Visualizations
**As a** user (especially judges evaluating technical sophistication)  
**I want to** see visually appealing, interactive charts and graphs  
**So that** I can easily understand trends and system performance at a glance

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN the user views trend data, THEN the system SHALL display professional, interactive charts
- WHEN chart data updates, THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations for data transitions
- WHEN the user hovers over chart elements, THEN the system SHALL display detailed tooltips with contextual information
- WHEN the user views charts on mobile devices, THEN the system SHALL adapt chart size and interactions for touch interfaces
- WHEN multiple metrics are displayed, THEN the system SHALL use consistent color schemes and visual hierarchy
- WHEN time-series data is shown, THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate time range controls (1h, 24h, 7d)

### US-8: Internationalization Support
**As a** Japanese or English speaking user  
**I want to** view the monitoring dashboard in my preferred language  
**So that** I can understand the monitoring information clearly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN the user accesses `/ja/monitoring`, THEN the system SHALL display all interface text in Japanese
- WHEN the user accesses `/en/monitoring`, THEN the system SHALL display all interface text in English
- WHEN metric labels and descriptions are shown, THEN they SHALL be localized to the user's language
- WHEN error messages occur, THEN they SHALL be displayed in the user's selected language

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance
- Dashboard initial load SHALL complete within 3 seconds
- Real-time updates SHALL have latency under 30 seconds
- Dashboard SHALL support concurrent access by up to 50 users

### NFR-2: Reliability
- Dashboard SHALL maintain 99% uptime during demo periods
- Data accuracy SHALL be within 5% of actual system metrics
- Dashboard SHALL gracefully handle service unavailability

### NFR-3: Security
- Dashboard SHALL NOT expose sensitive API keys or credentials
- Dashboard SHALL NOT log or store personal user information
- Dashboard SHALL implement rate limiting for API calls

### NFR-4: Compatibility
- Dashboard SHALL work on modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
- Dashboard SHALL be accessible via keyboard navigation
- Dashboard SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards

## Constraints

1. **Budget Transparency**: Must show cost information publicly for judge evaluation
2. **No Authentication**: Dashboard must be accessible without login for demo purposes
3. **Existing Services**: Must integrate with current MonitoringService, CostTracker, and related infrastructure
4. **Demo Context**: Optimized for hackathon demonstration and judge review
5. **Mobile-First**: Must work effectively on mobile devices for judge accessibility

## Success Criteria

1. Users can access comprehensive monitoring information within 2 clicks from any page
2. Budget transparency increases judge confidence in cost management
3. System health visibility demonstrates technical sophistication
4. Real-time updates provide compelling demo experience
5. Mobile accessibility enables judge review on any device
