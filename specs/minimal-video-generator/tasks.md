### ✅ **Real Video Generation Complete (August 27, 2025 - Evening Session):**
1. **Google Veo 3 Integration** - Real AI video generation working with Gemini API ($0.80 per video)
2. **URL Routing Fix** - Operation IDs with slashes now properly URL-encoded for Next.js routing  
3. **Firestore Compatibility** - Simple job IDs used for Firestore, complex operation IDs stored as metadata
4. **Video Proxy Endpoint** - `/api/video/[fileId]` handles Gemini API authentication transparently
5. **Mixed Mode Operation** - Real Veo API with mock Firestore for development testing
6. **End-to-End Workflow** - Complete real video generation verified working in browser
